## 1. Data Overview
The Students Performance in Exams dataset contains academic performance records of students, focusing on their achievement in mathematics, reading, and writing. Each record represents an individual student and includes demographic background information such as race/ethnicity and parental level of education, which provides context for analysing differences in academic outcomes.

```
- Race/Ethnicity (object): Student’s racial or ethnic group
- Parental Level of Education (object): Educational background of the student's family
- Math Score (int): Student performance in mathematics
- Reading Score (int): Student performance in reading
- Writing Score (int): Student performance in writing
```

The dataset comprises 251 rows and 5 columns, containing both categorical variables (race/ethnicity, parental level of education) and numerical variables (math, reading, and writing scores). This structure enables effective exploratory data analysis to identify performance patterns and variations across different student groups.

This dataset was chosen because it demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to understand academic performance trends and assess the influence of demographic factors on educational outcomes, supporting data-driven decision making in education and policy contexts.
