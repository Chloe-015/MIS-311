**Dataset**: Student Performance

**Student**: Thai Ngoc Mai Anh

**University**: Eastern International University

## 1. Data Overview
The Students Performance in Exams dataset contains academic performance records of students, focusing on their achievement in mathematics, reading, and writing. Each record represents an individual student and includes demographic background information such as race/ethnicity and parental level of education, which provides context for analysing differences in academic outcomes.

```
- Race/Ethnicity (object): Student’s racial or ethnic group
- Parental Level of Education (object): Educational background of the student's family
- Math Score (int): Student performance in mathematics
- Reading Score (int): Student performance in reading
- Writing Score (int): Student performance in writing
```

The dataset comprises 251 rows and 5 columns, containing both categorical variables (race/ethnicity, parental level of education) and numerical variables (math, reading, and writing scores). This structure enables effective exploratory data analysis to identify performance patterns and variations across different student groups.

This dataset was chosen because it demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to understand academic performance trends and assess the influence of demographic factors on educational outcomes, supporting data-driven decision making in education and policy contexts.
## 2. Data Overview
- Missing values were identified using Excel’s Filter function to check for blank entries in each variable. No missing values were found, therefore no data imputation or record removal was required.

- Duplicate rows were identified using Excel’s Remove Duplicates tool applied across all columns. The results showed no duplicate records, so all observations were retained for subsequent analysis.
